          Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
          typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard 
          dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
          of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
          only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typ
          esetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised 
          in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
          passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus 
          PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
